# Driver-Assistance-System
 <br/>Vehicles have a major contribution to the total energy demand as well as to harmful emissions. 
 <br/>In light of this, an important factor in creating sustainable cities is the reduction of energy required to power automobiles. A method of achieving the same is eco-driving. 
 <br/>Eco-driving is a term used to describe the energy-efficient driving of vehicles. By this principle, a driver follows certain principles while driving that help him reduce the total energy consumed. 
 <br/>A driver assistance system that will remind a driver to follow eco-driving principles when a certain principle is violated
